# Spark-Gap-Tesla-Coil
A Spark Gap Tesla Coil designed as a Physics Project for academic demonstration.
It demonstrates the design and construction of a Spark Gap Tesla Coil as part of my undergraduate Physics coursework.  
The model was built using basic electronic components and safety protocols.  

## Key Features
- High-voltage generation
- Corona Discharge
- Wireless electricity
- DIY construction

## Components Used
- Flyback Transformer
- Spark Gap Setup
- Film Capacitors ~6kV
- Suitable Resistor
- A MOSFET (To Create Oscilations)
- Primary Coil 5 turns
- Secondary coil ~ 500 turns

## Working
**Power Supply:** A high-voltage flyback transformer converts low-voltage Oscillations from the MOSFET to high-voltage AC, which is then fed into the primary coil.
**Resonance:** The primary coil and secondary coil are tuned to the same resonant frequency, allowing maximum energy transfer. 
**Spark Gap:** The spark gap acts as a switch, discharging the stored energy in the capacitor. When the voltage across the capacitor exceeds a threshold, the spark gap fires, releasing the energy into the primary coil.
**Energy Transfer:** The electrical energy from the primary coil induces a current in the secondary coil, which, due to the resonant frequency, amplifies the voltage and produces high-voltage discharges (sparks) from the toroidal top load.

## Result
The Tesla Coil successfully generated high-voltage sparks, up to approximately **2 cm** long, demonstrating the principles of electromagnetic induction and resonant circuits. The sparks were **visible** in a darkened room and **audible** with a loud cracking sound, which is typical of such high-energy discharges.

- **Voltage Output:** **50 kV**
- **Spark Length:** Approximately **2 cm**
